Welcome to your weekly Agile Fortune Cookie!

Today's fortune:

> "Seek progress, not perfection; for it is in the journey that wisdom unfolds."

This agile-inspired fortune cookie saying highlights the importance of focusing on progress rather than striving for unattainable perfection. Agile principles emphasize continuous improvement, learning, and growth throughout a project or journey. The quote suggests that by seeking progress and valuing the lessons learned along the way, one can gain wisdom and experience. In essence, it encourages individuals and teams to appreciate the process and the knowledge gained from it, rather than fixating solely on achieving a flawless outcome.

Check back next Friday for your Agile Fortune Cookie!
