Hello, hi, welcome, and all of the above!

I'm Jeff, the Digital Content Director of Agile Outlooks! This space is to be used for discussion on Agile methodologies, the tools that can give you an edge, fictional scenarios, and snippets of knowledge. This will also serve a second purpose: Help keep my Agile mind strong by talking about Agile!

To start off, every Monday we're going to host a multi-part series on a fictional company formed for software development. You may have already read on it, but the company is [AgileFusion Software Services](https://agileoutlooks.com/agilefusionsoutline/). Read up if you have a chance! This series will focus on the Software Consulting Services team, post company formation.

We also will post on lighthearted Agile topics every Wednesday. First post is [How to turn your dog into an Agile master](https://agileoutlooks.com/agiledoggy/)!

Finally, you'll be getting a small bit of fortune at the end of the week. Every Friday we'll post an Agile Fortune Cookie!

To streamline this site, we'll also be implementing some features that will provide a faster loading experience, track analytical data, and continuously deploy from our repo.

Nothing *crazy*, but enough to provide value and keep the ball rolling forward.

Please engage with us here! We'd love to hear your feedback on Agile Outlooks!

All the best.

- Jeff
