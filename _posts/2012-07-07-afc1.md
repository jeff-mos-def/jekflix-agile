Welcome to your weekly Agile Fortune Cookie!

Today's fortune:

> "Adapt and flow like water, for change is the only constant on the path to success."

This saying is inspired by agile principles and encourages one to be flexible and adaptable in their approach to achieving success. It suggests that one should be willing to adjust and evolve with changing circumstances, much like water flows and takes the shape of its surroundings. The phrase highlights the importance of embracing change, as it is a constant factor in any journey towards success. By staying open to change and being able to adapt, one is more likely to achieve their goals and overcome challenges along the way.
