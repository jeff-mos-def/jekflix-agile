Welcome to your weekly Agile Fortune Cookie!

Today's fortune:

> "Courageously embrace uncertainty, for it is the birthplace of innovation and growth."

This agile-inspired fortune cookie saying emphasizes the importance of courageously facing uncertain situations, as they often lead to innovation and personal or professional growth. Uncertainty can be a breeding ground for new ideas and creative solutions, as it forces individuals and teams to think outside the box and challenge the status quo. By embracing uncertainty rather than fearing it, one can unlock new opportunities and experiences that contribute to their overall development and success.

Check back next Friday for your Agile Fortune Cookie!
