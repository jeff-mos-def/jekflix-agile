# About

Hello there, fellow Agile aficionados!

I'm Jeff, the passionate Agile practitioner and enthusiast behind Agile Outlooks. I started this blog as a platform to share my insights, experiences, and expertise in Agile methodologies with like-minded professionals, teams, and organizations.

With over a fifteen years of combined experience in manufacturing, project management, and coaching Agile teams, I've seen firsthand the transformative power of adopting Agile principles and practices. My journey began as a manufacturing engineer and and project manager, but quickly transitioned into Scrum Master and Agile Coach roles, where I've had the opportunity to work with diverse teams, industries, and clients. Along the way, I've earned multiple Agile certifications, including Certified Scrum Master (CSM), SAFe Practice Consultant (SPC), SAFe DevOps Practitioner (SDP), and SAFe Agilist (SA).

Agile Outlooks is my way of giving back to the community that has given me so much. Through this blog, I aim to:

- Share practical tips, best practices, and strategies for effectively implementing and optimizing Agile methodologies.
- Provide insights on Agile frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe, to help teams and organizations choose the right approach for their projects.
- Discuss the Agile mindset, focusing on cultivating a culture of collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.
- Offer real-world case studies and success stories, showcasing the benefits of Agile adoption across different industries.
- Engage in open and honest discussions about the challenges faced by Agile teams, exploring potential solutions and lessons learned.

When I'm not immersed in the world of Agile, you can find me spending time with my dogs, up to my eyeballs in Grad school (Go Lions!), or planning my next adventure with my wife.

We post every Monday on current topics and Fridays with our Agile Fortune Cookie series!

Thank you for visiting Agile Outlooks! I hope you find value in the resources shared here and look forward to connecting with you through comments, social media, or even a good old-fashioned email. Let's embark on this Agile journey together and make a difference in the world of project management!
